# Color Assistant App
Made for a schoole assignment.
## Overview
The Color Assistant App is a mobile application designed as a digital helper for color theory. It targets creative professionals as well as individuals
who want to feel more confident in their color choices, such as people working with interior design, fashion, art, design, or floral arrangements.
The app combines elements of a design tool and a creative assistant.

## Purpose
Colors play a major role in everyday life, yet choosing harmonious color combinations can be challenging.
Many people tend to rely on safe options like black, white, or neutral tones due to uncertainty.
The purpose of this app is to make color theory more accessible, practical, and easy to use in everyday situations.

## Features
- Select a color in three different ways:
  - Interactive color wheel
  - Manual input using a hexadecimal color code
  - Color scanning using the device camera
- Generate color combinations based on common color harmonies:
  - Analogous colors
  - Complementary colors
  - Monochromatic colors
  - Triadic color schemes
  - Tetradic color schemes
- Visual examples and explanations for each color harmony
- Save favorite colors for quick access
- Use the app without creating an account
- User preferences such as language are saved between sessions

## Use Cases
The app can be used in a variety of real-world situations, for example:
- A florist creating balanced flower arrangements
- Someone checking whether a piece of furniture matches their home interior
- A user wanting to create more varied and confident outfit combinations

Users can scan a color at home, save it, and later access it while shopping, making the app a portable and personal color guide.

## Inspiration
The idea for the app comes from a personal interest in color and design, as well as real-life situations where color choices feel uncertain.
The app is inspired by *Color Cube* by Sarah Renae Clark, a physical color tool, with the goal of replacing it with a more flexible, digital,
and easily accessible solution.

## Why This Project
This project combines creativity, design, and technology. It makes use of mobile features such as the camera and interactive touch input to solve an everyday problem in a new way. The app simplifies advanced color theory and makes it accessible to users without prior knowledge, while maintaining a clean and user-friendly experience.
