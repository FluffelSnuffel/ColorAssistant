    <string name="information_about">
This app helps you explore and understand color harmony in a simple and intuitive way.\n
Start by selecting a color on the color wheel. Based on your choice,
the app suggests matching color combinations that work well together.
After picking a color, you’ll be taken to the Color Guide,
where you can explore different color relationships such as complementary,
monochromatic, analogous, triadic, and tetradic schemes.
Each guide explains how the colors relate to each other and when they are best used.
You can save any color you like to your Favorites for easy access later.
The Settings page lets you customize your experience,
and the About page provides more information about the app and its purpose.\n
Whether you’re designing, decorating, or just exploring colors,
this app makes it easy to find harmonious color combinations.
    </string>

    <string name="information_tetradic">
A tetradic color scheme uses four colors spaced evenly around the color wheel,
forming two complementary color pairs.
This creates a vibrant and dynamic palette that can make your designs pop.
When used strategically, it balances contrast and harmony.
    </string>

    <string name="information_complementary">
Complementary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel.
They enhance each other’s vibrancy when placed side by side,
creating high contrast and brightness. When mixed,
they neutralize each other, producing a less intense, neutral color.
</string>

    <string name="information_monochromatic">
Monochromatic refers to only having a single hue or color.
In graphic design, a monochromatic design uses only a single color in varying
tones- the color scheme is lighter or darker versions of the base color.
Monochromatic colors are often used to simplify designs and are often
an essential part of the color palette for a particular brand.
Whenever a design gets busy or cluttered,
monochrome comes in handy to make it look more cohesive.
It is one of the simplest forms of color palettes to use
and helps a design look cleaner and more sophisticated.
    </string>

    <string name="information_analogous">
An analogous color scheme is typically comprised of three colors
that fall next to each other on the color wheel:
the first is the dominant color,
the second is the supporting color,
and the third serves as an accent.
Black, white, and gray can also be incorporated
into any analogous color scheme.
Additional colors can be used
as long as they border each other
on the color spectrum.
Analogous color schemes occur heavily in nature
and find frequent use in the traditional arts.
    </string>


    <string name="information_triadic">
All triadic color examples consist of three colors that
are evenly spaced out on the traditional color wheel.
Black and/or white may also be present within a triadic harmony.
A traditionally-balanced triadic color scheme focuses on one dominant color,
with the other two evenly spaced colors both serving as accents.
Triadic colors stand out from one another and make for a vibrant,
lively color palette regardless of which particular colors are used.
Triadic color harmony refers to the pleasing appearance
that triadic colors have when used together.
